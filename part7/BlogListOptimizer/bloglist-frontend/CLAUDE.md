### Analysis Summary

I can help you visualize the project structure. To create a meaningful graph, I need to understand what aspects of the project you'd like to visualize. For example, are you interested in:

1.  **High-level directory structure?** (e.g., showing folders and subfolders)
2.  **Dependencies between modules or files?** (e.g., which files import or use others)
3.  **Class or function call graphs within specific files?**
4.  **A combination of these?**

Please specify what kind of "Graph" you're looking for, and I'll do my best to generate it.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Project Graph Request**
   The user is asking for a graph of the project. To provide a meaningful visualization, it's crucial to understand the specific type of graph desired. This could range from a high-level directory structure to detailed class or function call graphs, or a combination of these.

## Research Query

Investigate the "Application Core" component in detail. Provide a comprehensive analysis of its architecture, responsibilities, and implementation details.

*Session: b8f650bb02b7e9d23a462be34db8cce9 | Generated: 7/2/2025, 4:52:26 PM*

### Analysis Summary

I couldn't find a directory named `src/app/ApplicationCore`. It's possible the "Application Core" component is located elsewhere or named differently. Could you please provide the correct path or a more specific name for the component you'd like me to investigate?

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Research Outcome**
   The research report indicates that the requested component, `Application Core`, could not be found. It suggests that the component might be located elsewhere or named differently within the codebase. Therefore, further investigation requires clarification on the correct path or name of the component.
